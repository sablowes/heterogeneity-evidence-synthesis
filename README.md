# Modelling heterogeneity for quantitative evidence synthesis in ecology

Repo for models exploring heterogeneity in quantitative evidence synthesis.

There are two folders - one for each case study. Use the init-dir.R file
to set up the working directory, load packages and source a custom function
for plotting the results.

Each case study is described in detail in the accompanying paper. 

## Fragment size richness relationships

Extends the work of Chase et al. 2020 *Nature* to examine heteroscedasticity.

## Native exotic richness relationships

Extends the work of Peng et al. 2019 *Ecology* to quantify heterogeneity.
